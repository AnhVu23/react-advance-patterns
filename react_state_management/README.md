## React state management using hooks

Inspired by the tutorial: https://kentcdodds.com/blog/application-state-management-with-react

## Problems

State management is controversially the most difficult part of any application. Therefore, there are many approaches to resolve this solution in the market,
and more will come in the future. Most beginner React developers are familiar with Redux, which is arguably one of the best state management libraries.
However, Redux has some fallbacks. Dan Abramov, one of the creators or Redux, said that he would like to amend this: don't use Redux until you 
had problems with vanilla React.


## Solutions

React is not only an interactive user interface building library but also a state management tool. Prior to the hook release (version 16.8), 
React provides limited solutions to handle local and global state. However, React has reborn legacy Context API with new useState, useReducer and 
useContext hooks.
